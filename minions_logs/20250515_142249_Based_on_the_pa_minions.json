In his latest checkup, his blood pressure was recorded at 160/100 mmHg, and he reported occasional chest discomfort during physical activity. Recent laboratory results show that his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 170 mg/dL, while his HDL remains within the normal range at 45 mg/dL.

      "output": "To evaluate the risk of cardiovascular complications for John Doe, focus on his blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels. His blood pressure is significantly elevated at 160/100 mmHg, which is classified as stage 2 hypertension and is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 170 mg/dL, which further increases the risk of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular issues. The combination of high blood pressure and elevated LDL cholesterol suggests a heightened risk for cardiovascular complications, especially given his age and reported chest discomfort during physical activity. These factors indicate the need for medical intervention to manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 3 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

We'll break down the document into manageable chunks and assign atomic tasks to extract relevant details.

Each task is atomic and focuses on a single aspect of the context.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function processes the outputs from the worker model, filtering and aggregating the information based on the task type. It compiles the extracted data into a coherent string for further analysis.\n\nThis approach ensures that each task is manageable and focused, allowing for efficient extraction of relevant information from the document."

The context mentions a reading of 160/100 mmHg, which is classified as stage 2 hypertension.\n   - **Cholesterol Information**: We need the LDL cholesterol level. The context provides an LDL level of 170 mg/dL, which is considered elevated.\n   - **Symptoms Information**: The context mentions occasional chest discomfort during physical activity, which is a symptom that can be associated with cardiovascular issues.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information gathered is sufficient to evaluate the risk. We have the necessary blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels, both of which are key indicators of cardiovascular risk. Additionally, the symptom of chest discomfort during physical activity adds to the concern.\n\n3. **Deriving the Answer**:\n   - High blood pressure (160/100 mmHg) and elevated LDL cholesterol (170 mg/dL) are both significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The combination of these factors, along with the symptom of chest discomfort, suggests an increased risk for cardiovascular complications.\n   - Typically, stage 2 hypertension and elevated LDL cholesterol levels are managed aggressively to reduce the risk of heart disease and related complications.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the gathered information, it is reasonable to conclude that the patient's blood pressure and LDL cholesterol readings, along with the reported symptoms, suggest an increased risk for cardiovascular complications. This assessment aligns with standard medical guidelines for cardiovascular risk evaluation.\n\nIn summary, the collected information is sufficient to answer the question, and it indicates an increased risk for cardiovascular complications for the patient."
