The key components are: a) Assessing blood pressure readings, b) Assessing LDL cholesterol readings, c) Evaluating the combined impact of these factors on cardiovascular risk. \\n\\n2. Explain Each Component: \\n   a) Assessing blood pressure readings: High blood pressure is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the patient's blood pressure status is crucial for risk evaluation. \\n   b) Assessing LDL cholesterol readings: Elevated LDL cholesterol levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing cardiovascular risk. Evaluating these levels helps in understanding the patient's lipid profile. \\n   c) Evaluating the combined impact: Both high blood pressure and high LDL cholesterol can synergistically increase cardiovascular risk. Assessing their combined effect provides a comprehensive risk evaluation. \\n\\n3.
